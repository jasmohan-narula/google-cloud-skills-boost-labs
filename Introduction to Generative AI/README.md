What is an example of both a generative AI model and a discriminative AI model?

- Answer:
A generative AI model could be trained on a dataset of images of cats and then used to generate new images of cats. A discriminative AI model could be trained on a dataset of images of cats and dogs and then used to classify new images as either cats or dogs.

What is a prompt?
- Answer:
A prompt is a short piece of text that is given to the large language model as input, and it can be used to control the output of the model in many ways.


Hallucinations are words or phrases that are generated by the model that are often nonsensical or grammatically incorrect. What are some factors that can cause hallucinations? Select three options.
Answers:
